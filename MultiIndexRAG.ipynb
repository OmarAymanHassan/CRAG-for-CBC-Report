A nurse or lab tech will take a sample of blood by putting a needle into a vein in\\nyour arm. Afterward, you can leave and get back to your routine. They’ll send the blood to a lab for review.\\nWhat Does a CBC Measure?\\nThe test can tell your doctor a lot about your overall health. It measures:\\nWhite blood cells (WBCs). These help your body fight germs. If you have too many of them, it could be a sign of inflammation,\\ninfection, a medical reaction, or another health condition. If it’s low, you could be at a higher risk for infection.

Heavy menstrual bleeding\\n(HMB) in women is defined as the regular loss of more than 80 ml\\nof blood during a menstrual period, exceeding iron intake, and is\\nconsidered the most common cause ofiron deficiency (ID). Absolute ID\\noccurs when total body iron stores are insufficient to meet the needs of\\nthe individual. In functional ID, total body iron is preserved but iron is\\nmaldistributed. Functional ID is explained by reduced iron export via\\nferroportin, which is controlled by hepcidin‐dependent and independent\\nmechanisms in response to inflammation.\\n1 Consequently, iron absorp-\\ntion from the gastrointestinal systemis inhibited, and iron is trapped in\\nmacrophages, resulting in reduced circulating iron levels.2 Iron deficiency\\ncan lead to chronic fatigue, poor concentration, impaired exercise per-\\nformance, and poor quality of life.\\n3 As ID becomes more severe, it will\\ncause microcytic anemia.3\\nIron deficiency affects more than 2 billion people worldwide, with\\niron deficiency anemia (IDA) remaining the main'),\n",

Indeed, studies\\nmeasuring the absorption of an iron isotope in nonanemic ID women\\ndemonstrated that less frequent administration (from daily to alternate\\nday and from multiple to single doses) and lower dosages (40–80 mg\\nFe) could improve efficacy and tolerability of oral iron treatment, by\\nmaximizing fractional iron absorption, reducing gastrointestinal side\\neffects, and potentially increasing compliance. In a randomized trial\\ncomparing treatment regimes in subjects with IDA, 60 mg of elemental\\niron two times a day produced Nb increments similar to 120 mg\\non alternate days after the same total dose, with a lower prevalence\\nof nausea.\\n97\\nAlthough the absorption of oral iron is theoretically favored by an\\nacidic environment, administration of vitamin C is not recommended,\\nbased on a large randomized clinical trial (RCT) demonstrating that\\nvitamin C neither enhances the hematological response nor di-\\nminishes the side effects.\\n98\\nIn anemic patients, oral iron should be continued until the Hb\\nnormalizes, which may take 6–12 weeks (depending on the severity\\nof anemia). After Hb restoration, oral supplements should be con-\\ntinued for at least three months to adequately replenish iron stores\\n(with an ideal target of ferritin >100μg/L).\\n'),\n",

In 2005, Isbister introduced the term\\n“patient blood management” (PBM),\\n123 recently defined as a“patient‐\\ncentered, systematic, evidence‐based approach to improve patient out-\\ncomes by managing and preserving patients' own blood”.123 In 2017, the\\nEuropean Commission proposed PBMas a standard of care procedure.124\\nIn 2021, WHO released an awareness policy about the urgent need to\\nimplement PBM.125 A set of clinical and research recommendations was\\nthen established through an international consensus.126 There is still an\\nunmet need to formally prove the long‐term clinical benefits or cost‐\\neffectiveness of PBM.127 Nevertheless, preoperative iron deficiency an-\\nemia (IDA) is common, is associated with poorer postoperative outcomes,\\nand is a major predictive factor of peri‐operative ABT.128 Good clinical\\npractice dictates that the underlying cause of IDA should be diagnosed\\nand treated appropriately. The main challenge in PBM is how to do it\\npromptly, particularly when the interval between diagnosis and surgery is\\ntoo short. Another challenge is the management of ID without\\nanemia. While difficult to determine, it probably represents a much higher\\npopulation than IDA, but many of those patients probably do not need\\nABT, although they may need PBM.\\nRecommendation 3.c\\nIn the setting of major surgery, we recommend systematically screening\\nfor ID, offering oral iron before and after surgery in IDA patients, and\\nconsidering intravenous iron for patients with IDA who cannot tolerate or\\n12 of 16 | Recommendations for prevention of ID and IDA\"),\n",

Whether\\nor not a patient becomes symptomatic depends on the etiology of anemia, the\\nacuity of onset, and the presence of other comorbidities, especially the presence of\\ncardiovascular disease. Most patients experience some symptoms related to\\nanemia when the hemoglobin drops below 7.0 g/dL.\\xa0\\nErythropoietin (EPO), which is made in the kidney, is the major stimulator of red\\nblood cell (RBC) production. Tissue hypoxia is the major stimulator of EPO\\nproduction, and levels of EPO are generally inversely proportional to the\\nhemoglobin concentration. In other words, an individual who is anemic with low\\nhemoglobin has elevated levels of EPO. However, levels of EPO are lower than\\nexpected in anemic patients with renal failure. In anemia of chronic disease\\n(AOCD), EPO levels are generally elevated, but not as high as they should be,\\ndemonstrating a relative deﬁciency of EPO.\\nNormal Hemoglobin (Hgb)-speciﬁc laboratory cut-offs will differ slightly, but in\\ngeneral, the normal ranges are as follows:\\nEtiology\\nExplain the importance of collaboration and communication among the\\ninterprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients affected by anemia.\\n13.5 to 18.0 g/dL in men\\n12.0 to 15.0 g/dL in women\\n11.0 to 16.0 g/dL in children\\nVaried in pregnancy depending on the trimester, but generally greater than\\n10.0 g/dL'),\n",

Whether\\nor not a patient becomes symptomatic depends on the etiology of anemia, the\\nacuity of onset, and the presence of other comorbidities, especially the presence of\\ncardiovascular disease. Most patients experience some symptoms related to\\nanemia when the hemoglobin drops below 7.0 g/dL.\\xa0\\nErythropoietin (EPO), which is made in the kidney, is the major stimulator of red\\nblood cell (RBC) production. Tissue hypoxia is the major stimulator of EPO\\nproduction, and levels of EPO are generally inversely proportional to the\\nhemoglobin concentration. In other words, an individual who is anemic with low\\nhemoglobin has elevated levels of EPO. However, levels of EPO are lower than\\nSummarize the etiology of anemia.\\nDescribe the pathophysiology of anemia.\\nOutline the use of dietary supplements in the treatment of anemia.\\nExplain the importance of collaboration and communication among the\\ninterprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients affected by anemia.'),\n",

A nurse or lab tech will take a sample of blood by putting a needle into a vein in\\nyour arm. Afterward, you can leave and get back to your routine. They’ll send the blood to a lab for review.\\nWhat Does a CBC Measure?\\nThe test can tell your doctor a lot about your overall health. It measures:\\nWhite blood cells (WBCs). These help your body fight germs. If you have too many of them, it could be a sign of inflammation,\\ninfection, a medical reaction, or another health condition. If it’s low, you could be at a higher risk for infection. A medication, a viral\\ninfection, or a bone marrow disease could also cause a low count.\\nRed blood cells (RBC).\\xa0These deliver\\xa0oxygen throughout your body.

Generally, nonmenstruating\\nindividuals preserve iron very efficiently, losing less than 0.1% of their body iron content each day, an amount that is replaced\\nthrough dietary iron absorption. Most of the iron is in the hemoglobin (Hb) of red blood cells (RBCs); thus, blood loss is the most\\ncommon cause of acute iron depletion and anemia worldwide, and reduced hemoglobin synthesis and anemia are the most\\ncommon consequences of low plasma iron concentrations. The term iron deficiency (ID) refers to the reduction of total body iron\\nstores due to impaired nutrition, reduced absorption secondary to gastrointestinal conditions, increased blood loss, and increased\\nneeds as in pregnancy. Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is defined as low Hb or hematocrit associated with microcytic and hypo-\\nchromic erythrocytes and low RBC count due to iron deficiency. IDA most commonly affects women of reproductive age, the\\ndeveloping fetus, children, patients with chronic and inflammatory diseases, and the elderly. IDA is the most frequent hema-'),\n",

Generally, nonmenstruating\\nindividuals preserve iron very efficiently, losing less than 0.1% of their\\nbody iron content each day, an amount that is replaced through\\ndietary iron absorption. Most of the iron is in the hemoglobin (Hb) of\\nred blood cells (RBCs); thus, blood loss is the main cause of iron\\ndeficiency (ID) worldwide, and reduced hemoglobin synthesis and\\nanemia are the most common consequences of low plasma iron\\nconcentrations. Severe ID can also affect the synthesis of ferropro-\\nteins in nonerythroid cell types, causing cellular dysfunction and\\nleading to additional manifestations including epithelial changes in\\nnails, tongue, and esophagus, deficits in cognitive function and muscle\\nperformance, and impaired adaptive immune response.\\n1\\nThe term ID refers to the reduction of total body iron stores\\ndue to (a) decreased iron intake because of impaired nutrition, reduced\\nabsorption secondary to gastrointestinal diseases, and use of proton\\npump inhibitors, (b) increased utilization (e.g., pregnancy), or (c) increased\\niron losses, usually because of bleeding.

Whether\\nor not a patient becomes symptomatic depends on the etiology of anemia, the\\nacuity of onset, and the presence of other comorbidities, especially the presence of\\ncardiovascular disease. Most patients experience some symptoms related to\\nanemia when the hemoglobin drops below 7.0 g/dL.\\xa0\\nErythropoietin (EPO), which is made in the kidney, is the major stimulator of red\\nblood cell (RBC) production. Tissue hypoxia is the major stimulator of EPO\\nproduction, and levels of EPO are generally inversely proportional to the\\nhemoglobin concentration. In other words, an individual who is anemic with low\\nhemoglobin has elevated levels of EPO. However, levels of EPO are lower than\\nexpected in anemic patients with renal failure. In anemia of chronic disease\\n(AOCD), EPO levels are generally elevated, but not as high as they should be,\\ndemonstrating a relative deﬁciency of EPO.\\nNormal Hemoglobin (Hgb)-speciﬁc laboratory cut-offs will differ slightly, but in\\ngeneral, the normal ranges are as follows:\\nEtiology\\nExplain the importance of collaboration and communication among the\\ninterprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients affected by anemia.\\n13.5 to 18.0 g/dL in men\\n12.0 to 15.0 g/dL in women\\n11.0 to 16.0 g/dL in children\\nVaried in pregnancy depending on the trimester, but generally greater than\\n10.0 g/dL'),\n",

A nurse or lab tech will take a sample of blood by putting a needle into a vein in\\nyour arm. Afterward, you can leave and get back to your routine. They’ll send the blood to a lab for review.\\nWhat Does a CBC Measure?\\nThe test can tell your doctor a lot about your overall health. It measures:\\nWhite blood cells (WBCs). These help your body fight germs. If you have too many of them, it could be a sign of inflammation,\\ninfection, a medical reaction, or another health condition. If it’s low, you could be at a higher risk for infection.

In ID, iron\\nstorage must be severely depleted before anemia occurs since, while\\nin modest iron stores' reduction, the recycling of iron from the\\ndaily RBC turnover provides sufficient iron for erythropoiesis and\\nhemoglobin production.\\n4\\nIDA is defined as low Hb or hematocrit associated with\\nmicrocytic (low mean corpuscular volume, MCV) and hypochromic\\n(low mean corpuscular hemoglobin, MCH) erythrocytes and low RBC\\ncount.\\n4 IDA most commonly affects children, women of reproductive\\nage, patients with chronic and inflammatory diseases, and the\\nelderly.4 IDA is the most frequent hematological disorder in children,\\nwith an incidence in industrialized countries of 20.1% between 0 and\\n4 years of age and 5.9% between 5 and 14 years (39 and 48.1%\\nin developing countries).4 The response to IDA includes increased\\nEPO secretion to stimulate erythropoiesis and decreased hepcidin\\nproduction to increase intestinal iron uptake and mobilization of\\niron stores.\\nAs discussed in the subsequent paragraphs, the diagnosis, man-\\nagement, and treatment of patients with ID and IDA should be tailored\\naccording to the age and gender and underlying conditions, like during\\npregnancy.

Whether\\nor not a patient becomes symptomatic depends on the etiology of anemia, the\\nacuity of onset, and the presence of other comorbidities, especially the presence of\\ncardiovascular disease. Most patients experience some symptoms related to\\nanemia when the hemoglobin drops below 7.0 g/dL.\\xa0\\nErythropoietin (EPO), which is made in the kidney, is the major stimulator of red\\nblood cell (RBC) production. Tissue hypoxia is the major stimulator of EPO\\nproduction, and levels of EPO are generally inversely proportional to the\\nhemoglobin concentration. In other words, an individual who is anemic with low\\nhemoglobin has elevated levels of EPO. However, levels of EPO are lower than\\nexpected in anemic patients with renal failure. In anemia of chronic disease\\n(AOCD), EPO levels are generally elevated, but not as high as they should be,\\ndemonstrating a relative deﬁciency of EPO.\\nNormal Hemoglobin (Hgb)-speciﬁc laboratory cut-offs will differ slightly, but in\\ngeneral, the normal ranges are as follows:\\nEtiology\\nExplain the importance of collaboration and communication among the\\ninterprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients affected by anemia.\\n13.5 to 18.0 g/dL in men\\n12.0 to 15.0 g/dL in women\\n11.0 to 16.0 g/dL in children\\nVaried in pregnancy depending on the trimester, but generally greater than\\n10.0 g/dL'),\n",

Whether\\nor not a patient becomes symptomatic depends on the etiology of anemia, the\\nacuity of onset, and the presence of other comorbidities, especially the presence of\\ncardiovascular disease. Most patients experience some symptoms related to\\nanemia when the hemoglobin drops below 7.0 g/dL.\\xa0\\nErythropoietin (EPO), which is made in the kidney, is the major stimulator of red\\nblood cell (RBC) production. Tissue hypoxia is the major stimulator of EPO\\nproduction, and levels of EPO are generally inversely proportional to the\\nhemoglobin concentration. In other words, an individual who is anemic with low\\nhemoglobin has elevated levels of EPO. However, levels of EPO are lower than\\nSummarize the etiology of anemia.\\nDescribe the pathophysiology of anemia.\\nOutline the use of dietary supplements in the treatment of anemia.\\nExplain the importance of collaboration and communication among the\\ninterprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients affected by anemia.'),\n",

Whether\\nor not a patient becomes symptomatic depends on the etiology of anemia, the\\nacuity of onset, and the presence of other comorbidities, especially the presence of\\ncardiovascular disease. Most patients experience some symptoms related to\\nanemia when the hemoglobin drops below 7.0 g/dL.\\xa0\\nErythropoietin (EPO), which is made in the kidney, is the major stimulator of red\\nblood cell (RBC) production. Tissue hypoxia is the major stimulator of EPO\\nproduction, and levels of EPO are generally inversely proportional to the\\nhemoglobin concentration. In other words, an individual who is anemic with low\\nhemoglobin has elevated levels of EPO. However, levels of EPO are lower than\\nexpected in anemic patients with renal failure. In anemia of chronic disease\\n(AOCD), EPO levels are generally elevated, but not as high as they should be,\\ndemonstrating a relative deﬁciency of EPO.\\nNormal Hemoglobin (Hgb)-speciﬁc laboratory cut-offs will differ slightly, but in\\ngeneral, the normal ranges are as follows:\\nEtiology\\nExplain the importance of collaboration and communication among the\\ninterprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients affected by anemia.\\n13.5 to 18.0 g/dL in men\\n12.0 to 15.0 g/dL in women\\n11.0 to 16.0 g/dL in children\\nVaried in pregnancy depending on the trimester, but generally greater than\\n10.0 g/dL'),\n",
